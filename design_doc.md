### Project Design Document for AI Assistant/Bot for Airline Customer Service

#### Project Overview:
The primary objective of the AI Assistant/Bot is to augment the capabilities of airline customer service agents by providing them with real-time information and guidance. This application aims to streamline the process of managing customer inquiries and issues, thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the customer support offered by the airline. The assistant will act as a support system to quickly fetch information, automate routine tasks, and facilitate smoother interactions between the agent and the customer.

#### Design Overview:
The application will consist of several key components, each designed to handle specific aspects of the airline customer service process. Below is a detailed explanation of each component/page along with its primary functionalities:

     2. **Cancel and Rebook Flight:** Facilitates the cancellation and rebooking of flights directly from the dashboard.
     3. **Manage User Details:** Enables agents to access and update customer profiles and preferences.
     4. **Track Baggage and Complaints:** Provides tools to track and resolve baggage issues and customer complaints.
   - **Description:** This is the main dashboard where the customer service agent begins their session. It provides a summary view of the most common tasks and alerts the agent to any high-priority issues.

     2. **View Reservation Details:** Detailed view of each reservation, including customer information, flight details, and special requests.
     3. **Update Reservations:** Modify existing reservations, including seat assignments, meal preferences, and other accommodations.
     4. **Check-In Assistance:** Assist customers with the check-in process and issue boarding passes.

     1. **Log New Complaints/Issues:** Enter details of new customer issues or complaints.
     2. **View Open Cases:** Monitor ongoing issues and their status.
     3. **Update Case Status:** Update or close resolved cases.
     4. **Escalate Issues:** Escalate complex issues to higher-level support or management.
   - **Description:** This component is dedicated to handling and resolving customer complaints and other issues efficiently.

#### Flow:
- **Navigation Flow:** The application will have a top navigation bar for switching between the main pages (Dashboard, Reservation Management, Customer Profile, Support & Incident Handling). Each page will have a consistent layout with a sidebar for sub-navigation if necessary.
- **Site Map:** A simple hierarchical structure starting from the Landing Page, branching out to the main functional pages, and further to specific tasks or details.
- **Color Palette:** The design will use a calming and professional palette with blues and grays, accented with the airlineâ€™s brand colors to maintain consistency and brand recognition.
- **UX Philosophy:** The design will follow a philosophy of minimalism and clarity to ensure that the agents can find information quickly and perform tasks with minimal clicks. Emphasis will be placed on readability, easy navigation, and clear visual hierarchies.

#### Implementation:
The application will be developed using React, utilizing its component-based architecture to manage the different functionalities efficiently. React Router will be used for handling navigation, and state management will be achieved through Context API or Redux as needed to maintain a responsive and interactive user experience.
